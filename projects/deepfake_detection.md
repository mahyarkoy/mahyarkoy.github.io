## Generalizable and Scalable Deepfake Detection

Abstract: Deepfake methods transfer the motion of a source video to a target identity such that it appears to say the words uttered by the source. Given the rapid advancement of deepfake methods, will their generations eventually become indistinguishable from real videos? In this project, we empirically and mathematically show that deepfake methods will always leave an inevitable trace in their generated video, and then propose a self-supervised method capable of detecting this particular trace through intra- and cross-modal anomaly detection.
